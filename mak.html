      <h3>Project Details</h3>
      <p>The main project which is identified as "Software Project 1" (SP1) is a complete health care management system which have generally three types of user (Administration, Doctor & Citizen) in two different platforms (Web & Desktop).
         In "Software Project 1" our system can control the aughorization of Doctors & Medicines. It can also keep track of all medicines according to it's generic and distribution amount. 
         For the doctors the was a Desktop application which provides almost all types of needed features to the doctor. That software is optimized & fit for duty at any type of system with low hardware configuration & also at any area with poor network status.
         The Citizen portal is a web application which have all fundamental medical features for citizens.Thais full system is based on current centralized technology.

      <h3>Blockchain Project Details</h3>
      <p>
         After the main project which is "Software Project 1" we have decided to continue our "Software Project 2" whith a full new experimental topic "Blockchain" which is currently our national demand.
         Though we were introduced with blockchain long a go but that was from theoritical praspective. For implementation with in four months only it was also great challange for us. But we took the risk 
         & picked up one feature form our "Software Project 1" for implementing it in blockchain as "Software Project 2". Our feature in "Software Project 2" is to <i>manage the transparency of Doctor's information among the mass people by maintaining the proper security with Blockchain Technology</i>.
         To ensure the proper quality & standards we have developed our whole "Software Project 2" based on <b>Hyperledger Fabric</b> which is <i>enterprise grade permissioned distributed ledger technology (DLT) platform</i>.</br>
         Hyperledger was established under the <b>Linux Foundation</b> and also received contributions from <b>IBM, Intel and SAP Ariba </b> to support the collaborative development of blockchain-based DLT.

      <h4>User Portal</h4>
      <p>The User Interaction point with Blockchain </p>
      <p>This application is developed with "Express" & runs on Node.js. This is part of our current technology & runs on treditional server which is generally used for simplifying user interaction with the Blockchain technology.So it is just a portal to enter to a whole new technology where "Helth Card is needed to open the portel for that specific user". </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h4>Health Card</h4>
      <p>Virtual Card for User-Identity</p>
      <p>As we our system is based on Private Blockchain Network & its permission based so no user can not join or leave without the proper authorization.So every user needs to enrolles and leaves under one administration for each organization. When an Admin of an organization enrolls an user he/she will have a "Health Card" which holds the Digital Certificate of that organization & that user's identity. This "Health Card" will unlock the User-Portal to access to the Blockchain network on behalf of an organization.</p>

      <h4>Blockchain Network</h4>        
      <p>The actual technology which can be the Game Changer.</p>
      <p>Our "Software Project 2" is specially a whole new technology known as Blockchain. This is a distributed ledger technology. Though it have use on multiple Databases but for keeping the data record it has no dependencies on it. For keeping the data records it uses series of blocks where each block is cryptographically secured, write once & append only, distributed & replicated, desentrilized in it's pure form but have cross checking process.</p>
